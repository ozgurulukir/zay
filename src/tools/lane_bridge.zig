//! LaneBridge — a request/response sync primitive between a `lane` tool call
//! running on a lane's worker thread and the UI (`App`) on the main thread.
//!
//! The `lane` tool (like every tool) executes inside `Agent.run` on the
//! worker thread, so it cannot touch App-owned state (threads, split, parked
//! lanes) directly. The bridge mirrors the `ApprovalGate` pattern in
//! `tui/agent_worker.zig`: the worker posts a `Request` and blocks on a
//! condition; the UI services it every tick and resolves it with a
//! `Response`. Layer-agnostic — the App is a consumer, not a dependency.
//!
//! Requests are tracked as an intrusive linked list: the driver's `spawn`
//! can be in flight while a spawned worker's `list`/`read` is serviced in
//! the same tick, so a single-slot primitive would clobber the earlier
//! request and leave its lane blocked forever.
