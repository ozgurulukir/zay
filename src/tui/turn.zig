//! Turn — the lifecycle state machine for a single agent turn.
//!
//! A turn begins when the user submits a prompt and ends when the worker
//! emits the terminal `turn_finished` event. The worker always posts that
//! event last, even on cancellation (see `agent_worker.runAgentTurn`), so it
//! is the single terminal signal the machine waits for.
//!
//! The machine is pure: it owns no thread, turn view, worker, or allocator.
//! The App drives it by calling `submit`/`interrupt` and feeding every
//! `Agent.Event` through `apply`, which advances the state and returns an
//! `Outcome` describing what the App must do next. Keeping it pure makes the
//! interface the test surface — a scripted event sequence can assert the
//! whole state path with no TUI or background worker.
//!
//! The loading spinner the TUI shows while waiting for output is NOT part of
//! this machine. Whether a given chunk actually rendered (partial tool
//! arguments render nothing, for example) is known only to the thread
//! turn view, which owns that finer-grained display activity.
