//! Thread — a lane: one unit of parallel work the developer can branch, run an
//! agent in, and merge back. It bundles the always-present UI projection
//! (transcript + turn state) with an `engine` that is attached lazily.
//!
//! The engine is a sum type so the expensive parts — an `AgentRuntime` owns a
//! client connection, a session writer, and a worker thread — exist only when a
//! lane is actually being run:
//!   - `idle`     a parked lane: its jj workspace identity, but no runtime
//!                attached. Cheap. Smartlog entries, headless rendering, and
//!                tests live here. Wake it to attach a runtime.
//!   - `live`     workspace + an owned `AgentRuntime` (tools rooted at the
//!                workspace path). The lane is in use.
//!   - `archived` squashed into a target and popped: only the merge record
//!                remains, so there is no workspace path to dangle and no
//!                runtime to accidentally drive.
//!
//! The transcript/turn UI lives outside the union because it's needed in every
//! state (you still render a parked or archived lane's history), and a turn is
//! cheap value state. `id` is optional: bound once the lane has a persisted
//! session; null for a fresh or headless UI.
//!
//! Scaffolding for now — the `App` still owns the single primary lane as inline
//! fields; a later stage moves those into one of these.
