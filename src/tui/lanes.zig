//! Lane merge-source helpers — extracted from `tui.zig` (R7.4 of tui-split).
//!
//! Types and helpers for the parallel-lane merge workflow: identifying
//! the worktree backing a lane (`workingLaneOf`), and formatting merge
//! errors for the model-status bar (`laneErrorText`). The pure path
//! helpers (`pathsEqual`, `lastPathSegment`) live in the root leaf
//! `src/paths.zig` and are re-exported here for in-TUI callers — the
//! execution layer imports the leaf directly and must never reach them
//! through this file (it would pull the whole App into the executor's
//! dependency closure).
