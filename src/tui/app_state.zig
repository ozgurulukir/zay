//! Grouped `App` state sub-structs.
//!
//! Pulled out of `tui.zig` (R3 of `_pm/Projects/tui-split`) — the central
//! `App` struct grew to 70+ fields and the per-concern state kept bleeding
//! into each other. R3 splits the state into focused sub-structs, each
//! owning one concern. R1/R2 already routed cross-module access through
//! `pub` accessors, so this refactor is internal to `tui.zig` — every
//! call site of `self.<field>` inside `tui.zig` becomes
//! `self.<sub>.<field>`.
//!
//! Behavioural identity is preserved: every field keeps its default and
//! every operation mutates the same memory, just one struct level deeper.
