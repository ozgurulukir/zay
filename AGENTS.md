# Nova Guidelines

This project uses Zig 0.16. Consult the tigerstyle skill before writing code.

- `vendor/fzy/` is a vendored copy of the fzy fuzzy matcher (MIT) — compiled directly into the binary via `build.zig`; no separate build step required.
- Standalone command safety classifier lives in `tools/classifier/` (FastAPI / ModernBERT) and communicates with Nova via HTTP REST (`POST /classify`).
- `zig build install -Doptimize=ReleaseFast --prefix $HOME/.local` installs to `~/.local/bin/`.
- The app **compiles** on Windows (`zig build` → `zig-out/bin/nova.exe`); full runtime support is in progress and tracked in issues #26–#29 (config paths, bash shell, failing tests, lanes). Linux behavior is unchanged.

## Patterns & Engineering Notes

The codebase patterns (TUI architecture, MCP, Lua plugins, AI tool schema, type system, models.dev, config layering, reasoning, compaction, session resume, toast notifications) and the vxfw build gotchas live in `docs/PATTERNS.md`. Read the relevant section when working on a subsystem — they are intentionally not ingested into the system prompt.

- **Modular Protocol & Execution Decomposition:**
  - **`responses_request.zig` & `responses_events.zig`:** Wire request payload serialization and SSE delta/event decoding are separated from `responses_core.zig` (`INV-RESP-1`). All JSON schema formatting, dialect reasoning clipping (`wireEffortLabel`), and prompt-cache suppressions (`disable_prompt_cache`) live in `responses_request.zig`. Event accumulation, UTF-8 delta handling, synthetic call ID generation, and usage clamping live in `responses_events.zig`.
  - **`openai_request.zig` & `model_compat.zig`:** The chat-completions client mirrors the INV-RESP-1 split. `src/ai/openai_request.zig` owns the request-body serializer (`writeRequestPayload` + the `write*` family; dialect gating for `stream_options`, `max_completion_tokens`, cache fields, `enable_thinking`, the `reasoning` object); HTTP transport, retries, and stream parsing stay in `openai_compatible.zig`, which re-exports the module. `src/ai/model_compat.zig` owns the model/dialect quirk layer (`wireEffortLabel`, `clipEffortForModel`, `isQwenModel`, `normalizeMessagesForQwen`) shared by BOTH wire clients — `responses_request.zig` imports it directly, never through the chat-completions client.
  - **`executor_safety.zig` & `executor_validation.zig`:** Tool execution boundaries in `src/executor.zig` delegate validation and shell safety (`INV-EXEC-1`). Both live under `src/tools/` (`src/tools/executor_safety.zig`, `src/tools/executor_validation.zig`). Shell command classification, chained destructive command handling (`rm -rf /; ...`), and interactive observer confirmations live in `executor_safety.zig`. Multi-channel schema resolution (builtin/MCP/plugin) and argument type coercion/validation live in `executor_validation.zig`.
  - **TUI Presentation Decoupling (`INV-WIDGET-1`):** Leaf widgets under `src/tui/widgets/` (`message.zig`, `transcript.zig`) must not reference `App` directly. Pass scalar configurations (`has_model_configured: bool`) or isolated view models. `transcript.zig` and `loading.zig` are scalarized (no `App` field; per-frame construction sites compute the scalars, `blackhole_visible` writes back via `*bool`); `status_bar.zig`'s `agent.zig` import is test-scoped. The remaining App-aliasing widgets (input, overlay, diff, at_search, background_jobs, permission, status_bar) are accepted debt pending their own view models.
  - **Leaf Library Isolation (`INV-LEAF-1`):** Modules under `lib/` are pure leaves with zero imports from `src/` and compile independently.

- **Parallel lanes & worktree architecture.** Key files: `src/tools/lane.zig` (tool side, workspace borrow), `src/tools/lane_bridge.zig` (request/response bridge), `src/tui/lane_lifecycle.zig` (all lane ops + teardown + async worktree job), `src/tui/lifecycle.zig` (`handleTick` order: `drainAgentEvents` → `serviceLaneBridge` → `drainLaneNaming` → `deliverPendingLaneCompletions`; `createParallelLane` user flow). Limits: max 4 threads (driver + 3 lanes); global worktrees at `<home>/.config/nova/worktrees/<id>` resolved via `vcs.globalWorktreesDir`, branch `nova/<id>`; `worker_stall_ms = 180s`.
- **Worktree Invariants & Safety:**
  - **Path Normalization:** Always use `src/paths.zig::pathsEqual` (zero-allocation, slash-agnostic, case-folded on Windows) for comparing workspace borrow paths and worktree directories — `tui/lanes.zig` re-exports it as `lanes_util.pathsEqual` for in-TUI callers; `src/tools/pwsh.zig` and `src/background.zig` import the leaf directly. Never use byte-level `std.mem.eql`, and never re-introduce a `tui/` import from the execution layer to reach these helpers (it would pull the whole App into the executor's dependency closure).
  - **Teardown & Windows File Locking:** Worktree teardown must terminate background child processes first (`terminateLaneProcesses` via `background.terminateJobsInCwd`), use 4-attempt exponential backoff on Windows (`vcs.worktreeRemove`), and run `vcs.worktreePrune` (`--expire now`). All teardown sites unify through `cleanupLaneWorktreeAndBranch`.
  - **Startup GC & Git Prune:** Startup hygiene in `src/root.zig:run()` runs `vcs.gcOrphanedWorktrees` (7-day TTL) and `vcs.worktreePrune` to purge abandoned checkouts and sync `.git/worktrees` metadata.
  - **Non-Blocking Async Provisioning:** Heavy `git worktree add` runs on a background thread (`WorktreeJob`). `spawnLane` uses multi-tick polling across `LaneBridge.service` without blocking the TUI render loop; `advanceAnimations` and `decideShouldTick` query `anyAsyncWorktreeActive` to advance loading frames smoothly.
  - **PowerShell Root Containment:** `pwsh.zig` enforces root containment with `[System.IO.Path]::GetFullPath`, `paths.pathsEqual` (`src/paths.zig`), `$root.TrimEnd('\', '/')`, and blocks directory escaping (`Push-Location`/`Pop-Location`).
  - **Lua plugin lane & session awareness:** all plugin cwd resolution goes through
  `bridge.resolvePluginCwd` (`src/lua/bridge.zig`) reading
  `plugin_cwd_slot`, fed from `Agent.effectiveCwd()` (lane worktree OR
  `/resume` session cwd — the process cwd is frozen at the launch dir), set
  around plugin dispatch (`produceOutput`) and around the whole `runAll`
  (event callbacks; refreshed by `rerootFromRequester`). Never call
  `std.process.currentPathAlloc` directly in a bridge.

## Zig Development

Use `zigdoc` to discover APIs before coding.

```bash
zigdoc std.fs
zigdoc std.posix.getuid
zigdoc vaxis.Window
```

## Current Zig Patterns

**ArrayList:**

```zig
var list: std.ArrayList(u32) = .empty;
defer list.deinit(allocator);
try list.append(allocator, 42);
```

**HashMap/StringHashMap:**

```zig
var map: std.StringHashMapUnmanaged(u32) = .empty;
defer map.deinit(allocator);
try map.put(allocator, "key", 42);
```

**stdout/stderr writer:**

```zig
var buf: [4096]u8 = undefined;
var writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&buf);
defer writer.interface.flush() catch {};
try writer.interface.print("hello {s}\n", .{"world"});
```

**build.zig executable:**

```zig
b.addExecutable(.{
    .name = "foo",
    .root_module = b.createModule(.{
        .root_source_file = b.path("src/main.zig"),
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    }),
});
```

**JSON writing:**

```zig
var buf: [4096]u8 = undefined;
var writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&buf);
defer writer.interface.flush() catch {};

var jw: std.json.Stringify = .{
    .writer = &writer.interface,
    .options = .{ .whitespace = .indent_2 },
};
try jw.write(my_struct);
```

**Allocating writer:**

```zig
var writer: std.Io.Writer.Allocating = .init(allocator);
defer writer.deinit();
try writer.writer.print("hello {s}", .{"world"});
const output = try writer.toOwnedSlice();
```

## Zig Style

- `camelCase` for functions and methods
- lower-case `snake_case` for variables, parameters, and constants
- `PascalCase` for types, structs, and enums
- prefer `const foo: Type = .{ .field = value };` over `const foo = Type{ .field = value };`
- preferred file order: `//!` module doc comment, `const Self = @This();`, imports, `const log = std.log.scoped(...)`
- pass allocators explicitly; use `errdefer` for cleanup on error
- keep tests inline with the code they cover; a new file's tests only run once the file is reachable from the `src/root.zig` test root (its `refAllDecls`) — see **Test runner quirks**

## Safety

- Add assertions at API boundaries and state transitions; avoid trivial assertions.
- Keep functions small; push pure computation into helpers.
- Comments explain why, not what.
- **POSIX Environment Access:** Never index `std.c.environ` directly in loops. In Zig 0.16 on POSIX, `std.c.environ` is `[*:null]?[*:0]u8`. Use `const env_slice = std.mem.span(std.c.environ);` and pass to `std.process.Environ.createMap(.{ .block = .{ .slice = env_slice } }, gpa)` to prevent null-pointer segfaults in multi-threaded contexts.
- **Models.dev Registry Allocations:** `modelsdev.Registry` string storage uses an `ArrayList(u8)`. To prevent dangling slice pointers when building or merging providers, accumulate string offsets via `StringRef` (`start`, `len`) and resolve slice pointers only after all string appends complete. In `buildRegistry`, resolve `providers`/`models` slices only AFTER the model-id appends too — resolving `providers` before the model loop leaves its `id`/`name`/`base_url` slices dangling when `strings` reallocs to fit the model ids (api.json carries hundreds of models, so a realloc is guaranteed → SIGABRT in the picker). Regression test: `"buildRegistry provider slices survive model-string realloc"`.
- **Dynamic Context Compaction:** Never hardcode fixed context retention budgets when compacting history. Use `compaction.keepRecentTokens(context_window, config_keep)` (`src/context/compaction.zig`) so small-context models (8K/16K/32K) keep a scaled history window (35% of window, capped at the config `keepRecentTokens` default 8,000) and can always compact below their swap watermark. When a real usage anchor is available, `compaction.calibrateKeepBudget(base_keep, real_tokens, estimated_tokens)` shrinks the budget by the measured ratio so chars/4 undercounts (CJK ≈ 1.5 chars/token) still land the cut below swap; it never grows the budget.
- **Streaming SSE Tool Call Deduplication & Parallel Remap:** In `src/ai/openai_compatible.zig`, tool call names and IDs are atomic in streaming — first complete value wins; subsequent deltas are ignored. This deduplicates repeated names and prevents cross-tool concatenation. Some providers reuse `index: 0` for all parallel tool calls; `ToolCallStream` detects this by comparing tool-call IDs (always unique). When a new ID arrives at an occupied logical index, the call is forked into a new physical builder slot. Argument continuation deltas (no ID) route through the remap to the correct slot. Limitation: if the provider omits IDs entirely, collision detection is impossible and the second call is lost (first writer wins for the name). The over-cap reject (`index >= max_parallel_tool_calls`) logs the offending model id alongside the index/cap (L3) — `readStream` takes a borrowed `model` param used only for that log; the Responses-API client (`responses_core.zig`) has its own local `readStream` with no `max_calls` path, so L3 is inapplicable there.
- **Prompt-cache field suppression (C1/C2).** Some OpenRouter `:free` / gateway-fronted models (kimi, inclusionai/ling) reject `cache_control` and/or `session_id`/`prompt_cache_key` with HTTP 400, killing the whole turn. Two defenses: (a) a user-facing `context.disablePromptCache` flag (`disablePromptCache`/`disable_prompt_cache` in config; `ai.Config.disable_prompt_cache` on the wire) suppresses ALL cache fields in BOTH wire clients (chat-completions `openai_request.writeRequestPayload` AND Responses-API `responses_request.writeRequestPayload`), regardless of dialect — for OpenRouter this is top-level `cache_control` + native `session_id`, for OpenAI it is `prompt_cache_key`, and the Responses-API site is NOT dialect-gated today, so the flag is its sole gate; (b) a one-shot C2 downgrade in `Client.prompt` — on a 400 whose error body mentions "cache" (case-insensitive, `errorDetailMentionsCache`), rebuild the payload with cache fields stripped and retry the FULL 429/5xx budget once (`downgrade_done` gates it to a single rebuild; the outer `while (true)` loop runs at most twice). The downgrade is decoupled from the `attempt` counter because Zig's `while … : (step) { continue }` runs the step expr on `continue` — riding the counter would burn a user-facing retry slot. `disable_cache` is a `prompt`-local var seeded from `self.config.disable_prompt_cache` so C2 never fights the user's explicit flag.
- **Outbound provider headers (`ai/provider_headers.zig`, added 2026-09-04).** ALL outbound HTTP headers for AI requests flow through the `provider_headers` leaf — both wire clients' send sites and the `/v1/models` probe; never build extra headers ad hoc at a transport. It merges provider-required **auto** headers (OpenCode Zen `x-opencode-session` = the 32-hex session id + `x-opencode-client: nova`, mandatory on `opencode.ai/zen*` URLs since 2026-09-05; OpenRouter `X-Title` — the old `Client.app_title`/`app_referer` fields are deleted) with **user** headers from `providers.<name>.headers` (`{env:VAR}` raw on disk, expanded once per attach by `config/provider.zig::expandProviderHeaders`; parse rejects reserved transport names `authorization`/`content-type`/`host`/… and caps at 8). Precedence — user wins on case-insensitive name match — is resolved ONLY inside `provider_headers.build`; never re-implement it at a call site. Zen routing headers are NOT gated by `disable_prompt_cache`: they are mandatory transport identity, and `build` never receives that flag. Ownership: `ai.Config.headers` is borrowed at init; each client deep-dupes into `provider_headers_owned` (freed in `deinit`); `ResponsesConfig.headers` stays a borrowed static profile table (codex) appended BEFORE the provider set, so protocol headers win collisions. The chat compaction/naming clients carry `session_id` too (the pre-fix gap left the zen session header empty on summarizer/naming traffic). The models probe takes `Options{session_id, user_headers}` and builds its own specs from the URL; `model_loader.Job.session_id` is an owned dupe because the App may switch sessions mid-probe.
- **`reasoning_effort` value clipping — two composed layers (chat-completions + Responses API).** `wireEffortLabel(dialect, effort)` (`ai/model_compat.zig`, re-exported by `openai_compatible.zig`) is the **dialect layer only**: the `.minimal` dialect (Ollama, whose `/v1/chat/completions` accepts only `high`/`medium`/`low`/`max`/`none`) rewrites `xhigh→"max"` and `minimal→"low"`; `.openai` keeps raw labels (gpt-5 honours both). `clipEffortForModel(model, label)` is the **model layer only**: Qwen / DashScope rejects `high`/`max`/`minimal` (valid set `low`/`medium`/`none`/`xhigh`), so it maps them to `medium`/`low`; every other model passes through. Callers compose the two: `clipEffortForModel(model, wireEffortLabel(dialect, effort))` — in BOTH wire clients (`openai_request.writeRequestPayload` flat field, `responses_request.writeRequestPayload` `reasoning.effort` object), plus the `.dashscope` `enable_thinking` branch. Never fold one concern into the other — the split is what makes Ollama+Qwen work (dialect passes `high` through, model layer clips it). The Qwen gate `isQwenModel` is **case-insensitive prefix matching** (`qwen*`/`qwq*`) because HuggingFace/vLLM ids are capitalized (`Qwen/Qwen3-32B` — vllm-project/vllm#41114); a byte-level `startsWith` misses exactly the vLLM-hosted Qwens. The Responses API path (`useResponsesEndpoint: true`, opt-in) was initially a bypass — Ollama's `/v1/responses` silently ignores unknown reasoning fields (Go's default JSON decoder drops them, and the endpoint defines no reasoning struct), so it wasn't crash-causing, but clipping keeps the two clients consistent and is forward-safe. The `include:["reasoning.encrypted_content"]` emitted unconditionally by `responses_request` when reasoning is set is also silently ignored by Ollama's `/v1/responses` — left as-is because it's harmless noise and suppressing it for `.minimal` would require broader dialect-gating of the Responses API client.
- **Qwen single-leading-system normalization.** Qwen3.x ship a strict Jinja chat template that raises `System message must be at the beginning` on more than one `system` message or a non-leading one. `normalizeMessagesForQwen` (`ai/model_compat.zig`) merges all `system` messages into one (text blocks joined by `\n`) and hoists it to index 0; the gate is computed at the call site (`dialect == .dashscope or isQwenModel(model)`) so non-Qwen history is never rewritten. Ownership: the result carries a `rebuilt` flag — passthrough shares the caller's storage, rebuild owns exactly one merged system block; free ONLY via `deinitNormalizedMessages(gpa, list, rebuilt)`, which frees the owned block on rebuild and just the list storage otherwise.
- **Bash tool safety:** `validateCwd` (`src/tools/bash.zig`) keeps the cwd inside the project root, comparing against a **normalized** root (trailing slash can't defeat it) plus a best-effort realpath re-check so a symlink escaping the root is caught (realpath failure → lexical verdict). The destructive-command gate is **always armed**: `bash_safety.classify` takes an optional URL and runs the local matcher when none is configured. Temp files use hex-only names; stale `nova-bash-*` / `nova-bg_*` files older than 24h are pruned at startup; spills cap at 10MB.
- **Twin shell tools share one pipeline (`INV-SHELL-1`).** `src/tools/bash.zig`/`pwsh.zig` are thin `Backend` namespaces over `shell.Impl(Backend)` (`src/tools/shell.zig`, comptime contract validated by `validateBackend`'s `@compileError` checks); shared exec-layer capture (bounded rolling tail, spill `Sink`, `drainChild`) lives in `src/tools/capture_sink.zig` with the spill prefix/dir injected via the `Sink(comptime config)` namespace. Keep per-shell ONLY what the shells really differ on (containment guard scripts, background `CommandMode` + stderr-merge wrapper, prompt prefix, error label); the `validateCwd` split (bash lexical+realpath vs pwsh `paths.pathsEqual`) is semantic — never fold it. Both tool modules re-export `Impl`'s pub surface unchanged, so `executor.zig`'s duck-typed `shell_tool` and `registry.shell_tool` need no edits. The Backend contract must be extended in `validateBackend`, never by specializing one backend. Full pattern: `docs/PATTERNS.md` § "Shared shell-tool pipeline pattern".
- **Lua C-stack manipulation:** When building a Lua table of results from Zig, the results table must stay on top of the stack across every entry. The correct idiom is `newTable()` (push table) → push entry fields + `lua_setfield(L, -2, ...)` → `lua_rawseti(L, -2, n)` (pops the entry, leaving the table on top). A stray extra push before `lua_rawseti` with the wrong table index (`-3` instead of `-2`) writes the bare integer into `results[n]` instead of the entry table and **leaks one table per match** onto the stack. Annotate the expected stack layout (`[ ... | results_table ]`, `[ ... | results_table | entry ]`) at each push/pop site so the balance is auditable.
- **Glob/pattern slicing:** Never unconditionally slice byte 0 off a user-supplied pattern (`fp[1..]`). When the pattern is empty, `fp[1..0]` is an out-of-bounds slice → Zig panic → `SIGABRT`. Lua treats `""` as truthy, so a plugin forwarding `file_pattern = ""` reaches this path directly. Extract suffix logic into a pure `fileNameMatches(name, pattern)` helper that handles empty (match-all), `"*x"` (strip leading star), and bare-suffix cases, and unit-test the empty case explicitly.
- **Skill buffers freed on every path.** `loadOne` and `appendSkillBlock` (`src/skill.zig`) both use a plain `defer gpa.free(raw)` registered immediately after the alloc — never `errdefer` (which leaks on the success path). The buffer is read from disk (up to 256KB per skill) and only the frontmatter values are duped into the returned `Skill`/written into the prompt; without the defer, loading N skills leaks N×256KB per runtime creation and each `$skill` invocation leaks per turn. Registered *before* the `try readSliceAll`, the defer also covers a failed read.
- **Skill invocation dedup must match `find`'s case sensitivity.** `find` is case-insensitive (`eqlIgnoreCase`), so `collectInvocations`'s `contains` helper must also be case-insensitive. If `contains` uses exact `mem.eql`, a prompt like `$Tiger and $tiger` passes both tokens through, and `promptPrefix` injects the same skill body twice — wasting tokens and confusing the model. Keep `contains` and `find` in lockstep.
- **Skill name validation rejects XML-special chars.** `isValidSkillName` rejects `"`, `'`, `&`, `<`, `>` in addition to whitespace and `$`. This is not just cosmetic: `appendSkillBlock` escapes these via `writeXmlEscaped`, but `collectInjectedSkillNames` (resume path) parses `<skill name="…">` without unescaping. If a name contained `"`, the escaped `&quot;` would be returned verbatim on resume, showing the wrong skill name in the `[SKILL]` transcript row. Rejecting XML-special chars at load makes the "no unescaping needed" invariant (TD-14) hold.
- **`McpClient.stop()` must free a `.failed` reason.** `stop` clobbers `lifecycle` to `.disabled`; if the client carries an owned failure reason (set via `setError`), free `lifecycle.failed.reason` **before** overwriting the lifecycle, or the reason leaks silently (`deinit` calls `stop` before its `failed`-arm switch, so the switch can never see it). Caught by the async-connect tests.
- **Historical tool-result pruning must never prune everything when no turn exceeds budget.** `computeCutoff` (assembly.zig) counts a contiguous `.tool` run as **one turn** (increments only at run end), so a parallel batch of 8 tools counts as 1 turn. When `cutoff_index == messages.len` (no turn exceeds the keep budget), the old code pruned the entire history; guard with `pruning_active = cutoff_index < messages.len` in `pruneHistoricalToolResultsViews`. Keep `estimatePrunedTokensRange` in lockstep by reusing `computeCutoff` over the full slice.
- **Persist before caching — the tree is the source of truth.** `appendPersisted` (manager.zig) writes to the DB first, then updates the cache. Cache-behind is healable on restart; cache-ahead is not. The session serializer maps OOM to `error.WriteFailed` (not `error.OutOfMemory`), so tests must expect that.
- **`readSliceShort` vs `readSliceAll`.** `readSliceShort` returns the actual byte count and never `error.EndOfStream`; `readSliceAll` returns `error.EndOfStream` when the buffer can't fill. Use `readSliceShort` when truncating oversized inputs (e.g. project rule files capped at 64KB) and shrink the slice on a short read. Also: a `return null` inside a `catch` block does **not** fire an `errdefer` — free the buffer explicitly before returning.
- **Mention/image ingestion caps.** `at_mention.zig` caps a single file mention at 64KB (`per_file_mention_max_bytes`), an aggregate of 256KB per turn (`turn_mention_aggregate_max_bytes`), and 4 images per message (`max_images_per_message`). Oversized files are read as a head+tail sandwich (first half + last half of the budget, joined by `common.elideMiddle`) so a plan's load-bearing conclusion at the tail survives, with a `[file truncated: {n} bytes — re-read via shell if you need the rest]` notice; over-cap images are skipped, not truncated. The elision format is the shared `common.elideMiddle` SSOT (also used by `pruneToolText` for tool-result truncation).
- **Epoch date math for `todayUtc`.** `std.Io.Timestamp.now(io, .real)` → `EpochSeconds.getEpochDay()` → `EpochDay.calculateYearDay()` → `YearAndDay.calculateMonthDay()` → `MonthAndDay`. `month.numeric()` is 1-based; `day_index` is 0-based (add 1).
- **Lua sandbox instruction budget is per-dispatch, not per-session.** `resetInstructionBudget(L)` (`src/lua/sandbox.zig`) zeroes the instruction count and re-arms the timeout deadline before each tool call / event dispatch (`callToolHandler` in `plugin_api.zig`, `drainEventCallbacks` in `manager.zig`). Without it the count is a session accumulator and a busy plugin eventually fails every call with "instruction limit exceeded" for the rest of the session. The hook reads its state via `lua_getextraspace` hook data; the timeout check runs every 1000 instructions.
- **Bridge integer-clamp idiom.** When a Lua-supplied integer flows into a `u32` field, clamp on the `i64` *before* the `@intCast` so a negative value can't wrap to ~4e9: `@intCast(@max(v, 1))` for positive-only params, `@intCast(@max(v, 0))` for "0 = unlimited" params. For capped params, wrap the clamp in `@min(..., cap)`. See `searchFiles`/`findFiles`/`runBash` (`plugin_api.zig`) and `parsePermissions` (`manifest.zig`).
- **`sanitizePath` realpath re-check mirrors `validateCwd`.** `sanitizePath` (`plugin_api.zig`) does a lexical `startsWith(cwd)` check, then a best-effort `std.c.realpath` re-check so a symlink escaping the project root is caught. `realpath` returns null on ENOENT (a new file being written), so fall back to the lexical verdict on null — never reject a legitimately-new path. This mirrors the bash tool's `validateCwd`.
- **Lane re-rooting takes effect from the next tool call, not the next batch.** `ExecutorService.cwd` starts as a per-batch snapshot from `agent.effectiveCwd()` (`runToolBatch`, agent.zig), but `runAll` calls `rerootFromRequester()` after every `lane` call (executor.zig) — so a `lane enter`/`leave` mid-batch re-roots the *remaining* calls in the same batch, matching what the `enter` response already claims. `rerootFromRequester` re-reads `effectiveCwd()` off the `lane_requester` (`*Agent`); it is a no-op when no requester is attached (headless/tests) or the workspace didn't change. Contained workers never change workspace (`enter` is driver-only), so the refresh is inert there. The `executor → agent` import is safe — the cycle already exists via `executor → tools → lane → agent`.
- **`Agent.workspace` is cross-thread, mutex-guarded (fixed 2026-08-05).** Worker threads write it (`lane enter`/`leave` via `setWorkspace`, defined in `src/agent.zig` with call sites in `tools/lane.zig`); the UI thread reads it (`driverWorkspace`, `listLanes`, `clearWorkspaceBorrowForPath`, `lane_column`). A 16-byte slice store can tear, so the field is guarded by `workspace_mutex` and accessed only through `setWorkspace`/`workspaceBorrow`/`effectiveCwd` — never directly. The lock is never held across tool dispatch. The precondition (no by-value copies of a live `Agent` after init) was verified before adding the mutex; `AgentRuntime.agent` is the single owner, and `Agent` already held a `message_queue_mutex`.
- **Lane bridge `service` holds its mutex across the handler.** `spawnLane` runs `git worktree add` + `createRuntime` on the UI thread under the bridge lock (visible UI freeze per spawn). Two-phase service (snapshot under lock, process unlocked) is unsafe: `Request` lives on the worker's stack and the worker may cancel after `service` returns — the handler must not outlive the lock.
- **Client attach must never rebuild `tools_json` from an unwired registry (fixed 2026-08-09).** `initSession` runs `applyFromConfig` (client attach) BEFORE the App wires `agent.tool_registry` / `runtime.mcp_tools` — that wiring lands after `createRuntime` returns (`session_switcher.zig` / `lane_lifecycle.zig`). `replaceClient` (runtime.zig) therefore guards its `updateMcpTools` rebuild on `tool_registry != null`: an unwired rebuild with the empty builtin override serializes `"[]"`, wiping the bash/lane definitions `init` just built and leaving the whole session tool-less — the user-visible symptom is `openai_compatible: sending request with NO tools (tools_json is empty)` on EVERY turn after a `/new`, `/resume`, or lane spawn. `createRuntime` pushes the merged list itself once wiring lands (`provider_model.injectToolsInto`); the startup session is rescued by the one-shot `mcp_connect_pending` tick instead. The compaction/naming clients are INTENTIONALLY tool-less (`tools = &.{}`) — the same warning from them is benign; disambiguate via the `no_tools client model= url=` info line and the request body (summarizer/naming send one user message, the main client sends the full system prompt). Regression tests: `"attach during initSession keeps builtin tools when registry is unwired"`, `"attach rebuilds tools from the registry once it is wired"`, `"createRuntime wires the full tool set into the freshly-attached client"`.
- **Lane engine states: idle vs live.** `Thread.Engine` is `union(enum) { idle: vcs.Lane, live: Live }` where `Live = { lane: vcs.Lane, runtime: *AgentRuntime, owns: bool }`. Idle lanes — created via `lane create` (`lane_lifecycle.zig`, the idle-create op near :1070) or rested via `parkFinishedWorker` (`lane_lifecycle.zig:1792`, which nulls `worker_context`/`agent` and downgrades `engine` to `.idle`) — have `worker_context = null`, `agent = null`, `liveRuntime() == null`; they cannot run a turn until a runtime is attached. `cycleLane` (`lane_lifecycle.zig:455`) sets `app.thread` to any lane including idle ones — no guard. `createRuntime` (`session_switcher.zig:398`) uses `templateRuntime()` (the first live lane's runtime) as a template and wires the agent fully (background_manager, mcp_manager, tool_registry, plugin_manager, lane_bridge, request_limiter). Any code that dereferences `worker_context` or `agent` off `app.thread` must guard for the idle case. Two submit-path guards enforce it: `beginSubmit` (`turn_lifecycle.zig`) refuses with an idle-lane notice before `toOwnedSlice` (preserves the typed input), and `submitMode` (`mode_lifecycle.zig`) guards the runtime-dereferencing branches — the `.provider_picker`/`.model_picker`/`.session_picker` modes at entry and the `.new`/`.resume_session`/`.timeline`/`.connect` command cases per-case (the other commands are idle-lane-safe and stay unguarded). Both post the same guiding notice ("`lane enter` / `lane spawn`") via the shared `refuseOnIdleLane` helper; safe lanes never trigger it (the primary is always live).
- **Background tool context bridge & bounded I/O (`background_slot`):** Fixed-signature tools (`Tool.run`) access `BackgroundManager` through the thread-local `background_slot` bound in `ExecutorService.produceOutput` and unwound with `defer`. `readLogTailBounded` (`src/tools/background.zig`) enforces bounded reverse I/O (max 64 KB scan, max 200 lines), skips leading UTF-8 continuation bytes (`0x80..0xBF`), and handles both relative/absolute paths across Windows and POSIX without panics. All 3 builtins (`shell`, `lane`, `background`) must be preserved across registry and client tool rebuilds.
- **Lua Plugin Sandbox, Memory & Require Safety:** `nova.require(mod_path)` resolves strictly within `plugin_dir` (enforced via `std.fs.path.resolve` + prefix and separator boundary check) and caches modules in `LUA_REGISTRYINDEX["nova_loaded_modules"]` with a sentinel `true` to prevent circular-require infinite recursion. `State.raiseError` formats into a stack buffer (`[512]u8`) before calling `lua_error` (zero heap allocations before longjmp). `globMatchSegment` treats `/` and `\` interchangeably for cross-platform path matching. `deletePath` verifies `clean_path != cwd` to protect the project root from deletion. On Windows, plugin and prompt discovery probes `%APPDATA%\nova\plugins` before falling back to `.config\nova\plugins`.
- **Cross-project `/resume` plugin repoint:** `PluginManager.repointProjectDir` repoints project-scoped plugin discovery (`.nova/plugins/`) under an `anyLaneTurnActive` guard — if any lane has a live turn, the switch is refused (`error.InFlightTurn`). Unloading Lua states and stripping tool records from the shared registry while a worker dispatches through them is a use-after-free hazard (`openPlugins` must NOT call `registerPluginTools` for the same reason). Global plugins and their states, event subscriptions, and require caches are never touched. Re-registration goes through `registerPluginTools`' idempotent strip+re-add only when no lane is mid-turn.

## Verifying

Run:

- `zig fmt`
- `zig build test`
- `zig build test-plugin` — runs the example Lua plugins' `test.lua` suites. Its exit code is the gate: must be 0. `test_runner.run()` is idempotent; `test_runner.zig` logs at `warn` (not `err`) so the intentional syntax-error test doesn't fail the build. Add a new plugin's `test.lua` to the `test-plugin` arg list in `build.zig`. The Zig runner auto-runs `return test_runner.run()` after loading each file and **fails on 0 tests** — a test file with no `it` blocks is a failure.

### Test runner quirks (read before debugging a failure)

The authoritative signal for a test run is `zig build test`'s **exit code**, not its printed output:

- **`--listen=-` false failures.** `zig build test` drives the build-server protocol and intermittently prints `failed command: /usr/lib/zig/... zig test ...` with a red Build Summary even when every test passes. If `EXIT=0` the run passed — ignore that line. Filter it out: `zig build test 2>&1 | grep -v '^failed command'`.
- **Test output is on stderr.** Both the `zig build test` step and the standalone `test` binary write their results to STDERR, so `2>/dev/null` hides everything and `2>&1 >/dev/null` reveals it. The standalone binary is authoritative when you need a real count: `ls -t .zig-cache/o/*/test | head -1 | xargs -I{} sh -c '{} 2>&1 >/dev/null | tail -3'` (expect `All N tests passed.`).
- **Stale cache with `-Dtest-filter`.** The `addTest` cache key does not distinguish `-Dtest-filter` filters, and `ls -t .zig-cache/o/*/test` can surface an older binary. After changing filters or code, trust `zig build test`'s exit code or the freshly built standalone binary — never a cached artifact's count.
- **Silent test discovery.** The test root is `src/root.zig`, which ends with `std.testing.refAllDecls(@This())` — only `test` blocks in files reachable through its `pub const` imports are compiled. A new file that nothing imports compiles fine but its tests **silently never run**. Wire the file into the module graph — add a `pub const` in `root.zig`, or import it from a module already in the graph — to make its tests appear.
- **A lazy `pub const tests = @import("tui/tests.zig")` on `tui.zig` is NOT enough.** `refAllDecls` only takes the address of the *referencing* module's own decls; nothing takes the address of `tui.tests`, so `tests.zig` is never analyzed and its test blocks silently vanish. The TUI tests are wired with `_ = @import("tui/tests.zig")` **inside `root.zig`'s `test` block** — reference the moved file's address directly, don't re-export it lazily. Verify any moved test file by strings-scanning the fresh binary for its test names, not by the suite exit code.
- **Test-fixture lifetime pitfalls:**
  - A helper that dupes its inputs leaks the temp: `appendViolation` dupes `got`/`expected`, so a caller passing `valueShortRepr(...)` / `toOwnedSlice(...)` results must `defer gpa.free` those temps, or DebugAllocator reports a leak at teardown.
  - A `&.{…}` compound literal with runtime elements lives on the **current frame's stack**. If later teardown dereferences the schema after the helper returned, the free hits garbage. Test fixtures that outlive the helper must `gpa.alloc` the backing array; empty `&.{}` literals are fine because they live in read-only memory.
  - **`FailingAllocator` with an explicit `fail_index` beats `checkAllAllocationFailures` for OOM tests.** `checkAllAllocationFailures` requires the test fn to take the allocator as its first arg and fails when the *input construction* also allocates with the failing allocator. When building inputs with the real allocator and failing only inside the code-under-test, use `FailingAllocator` and set `fail_index` directly, then assert the expected error path and that no partial copies leak.

## Gotchas

- **`std.atomic.Mutex` is a spinlock.** In Zig 0.16, `std.atomic.Mutex` busy-waits and pegs the CPU on multi-core (80% at idle). Always use `std.Io.Mutex` / `std.Io.Condition` (paired via `static_thread_pool` or similar). All existing sites have been migrated — do not reintroduce `std.atomic.Mutex`.

- **`std.Io.Mutex` is not recursive — a function-scoped `defer unlock` plus a later re-lock deadlocks.** `BackgroundManager.start` hit this; fixed by unlocking immediately after `next_id += 1` (background.zig, `start`'s id-allocation critical section) — it guards only the id/job list. Lock only around the minimal critical section; never pair a function-scoped deferred unlock with a second `lock`. Related: `MultiReader.fill(timeout)` is an **idle** timeout, never a total cap; `bash_exec` converts once to an absolute deadline (`Io.Timeout.toDeadline`).

- **`postAgentEvent` owns the event.** It frees the event's data internally on error. Callers must NOT free `message_text` or `event_ptr` in catch blocks or before `return error.TurnCancelled` — doing so causes a double-free.

- **Zig 0.16 std API gaps.** Use C shims or `std.Io` equivalents: no `std.fs.realpathAlloc` → `std.c.realpath` (returns null on ENOENT); no `std.posix.symlink` → `std.c.symlink`; no `std.fs.makeDirAbsolute` → `std.Io.Dir.cwd().createDirPath`; no `std.time.nanoTimestamp` → `std.c.clock_gettime(std.c.CLOCK.MONOTONIC, &ts)` (instruction hook has no `Io` handle; fall back to 0 = no timeout on failure).

- **codebase-memory-mcp project id is `home-aristo-Projects-nova-agent`** (path-derived). Plain `nova-agent` does not resolve.

- **Stale `zig build install` artifact can silently ship old code.** `zig build install` copies the cached executable to the prefix; a stale `.zig-cache` artifact is copied verbatim, so the installed binary may keep running pre-fix code even after the source is changed — `zig build install` exits 0 and the file timestamp does not move. If a fix appears to have no effect on the installed binary, verify the binary actually contains it (`nm ~/.local/bin/nova | grep <symbol>`) and its mtime advanced; when in doubt, `rm -rf .zig-cache && rm -f <prefix>/bin/nova` then rebuild and install.

## Known Issues

- **Session resume segfault (null `model_id`).** Crash at `src/ai/openai_compatible.zig:59` (`gpa.dupe(u8, config.model)`) when a null `summary.model_id` flows into `ModelSelection.custom.model.id` (non-optional `[]u8`). Guarded at three entry points: `runtime.applyFromConfig` skips attachment on empty `model_id`; `tui.applySelectedModel` returns `error.EmptyModelId`; `writeRequestPayload` returns `error.EmptyModelId`. Always use a real early return, never `std.debug.assert` — `unreachable` is UB in ReleaseFast. Previous fix: `da7c761`.

- **Debug prints masking segfaults.** Adding `std.debug.print` can change a segfault into a downstream error (e.g. `session.resume.failed err=Sqlite`). Suspect use-after-free or double-free between the crash site and the new error.

- **ReleaseFast debugging.** Use `std.debug.print` not `std.log.debug` — ReleaseFast strips log levels, so `std.log.debug` is a no-op.

- **Session config copy semantics.** `session_config` is a value-copy of `config`; union fields are shallow-copied, so mutating a union field on the copy doesn't affect the original.

- **vxfw FocusHandler crash on empty `path_to_focused` (LOCAL VENDOR PATCH REQUIRED).** Resume/session-switch crashes (SIGSEGV in ReleaseFast, assert in Debug) at `vxfw/App.zig:590`. Cause: `installRuntime` (transcript_lifecycle.zig) deinits the old runtime while vxfw's `focused_widget` still points at a TextField in that destroyed runtime; the next frame leaves the focus path empty and the next key event dereferences it. Upstream bug (HEAD `cca454be`), so a vaxis bump does NOT fix it. **Two guards applied manually** to the vendored `src/vxfw/App.zig` (search `NOVA-LOCAL-PATCH`): (1) `update()` falls back to `self.root`; (2) `handleEvent()` returns early instead of `assert(path.len > 0)`. Remove both once the upstream PR lands past the pinned commit.

  **Enforcement:** `checkVaxisFocusPatch` (build.zig) runs at configure time on EVERY `zig build` invocation — it reads `vaxis_dep.path("src/vxfw/App.zig")`, requires both `NOVA-LOCAL-PATCH` markers, and fails the build with the repair command when either is missing, so a fresh `zig build --fetch` / vaxis bump can never compile unpatched (the vendor dir is gitignored; this exact regression happened once — the 2026-09-06 fetch landed unpatched and shipped the crash). The checked-in patch file `tools/vendor-patches/vaxis-focus-handler.patch` reproduces both guards on a pristine vendor copy:

  ```sh
  patch -p1 -d <vaxis vendor dir printed by the build failure> < tools/vendor-patches/vaxis-focus-handler.patch
  ```

  On machines without `zig-pkg/` vendoring the dependency resolves from the global package cache — patch that printed path (the guards are additive, so other projects sharing the cached copy are unaffected). Manual recipe, if patch(1) is unavailable: 1. In `FocusHandler.update`, guard `if (self.path_to_focused.items.len == 0)` → append `self.root`, else fall through to the original `else if`. 2. In `FocusHandler.handleEvent`, replace `assert(path.len > 0);` with `if (path.len == 0) return;`.
  Verify: build ReleaseFast, run the PTY repro (open `/resume`, select a session, type a prompt, press keys) — must NOT signal 11.

- **`installRuntime` (session switch) checks only the active lane's turn — by design.** Other lanes keep running against their own runtimes; each lane owns its runtime, so a switch must not tear down lanes still in use. Completion routing is generation-safe across the switch (M1). Documented in `transcript_lifecycle.zig`.

## Logging

- **Sinks:** In Debug mode, logs go to both `nova.log` and stderr. In Release builds, logs go to stderr only (`warn` level and above by default). The file-writer thread is Debug-only (`logger.enabled_file`); the stderr sink is compiled in all builds, so the shipped ReleaseFast binary keeps an operational trail. Every line carries an ISO-8601 UTC timestamp prefix (`lib/logger.zig` `formatTimestamp`, via `clock_gettime(REALTIME)` — no `Io` handle available in the writer thread / pre-init path).
- **Toast routing (warn+):** `logger.Options.toast_sink` is an opaque `?*const fn (level, msg) void` installed by `root.run`. With the TUI up, `warn`+ messages route to the global toast bus (`src/tui/toast.zig`) **instead of stderr** — stderr bytes land in the alternate screen and tear the rendered frame, so the toast overlay is the intended surface. The routing decision in `dispatch` keys off `stderr_explicit`: when `NOVA_LOG_STDERR_LEVEL` is **not** set and a sink is installed, `warn`+ goes to the toast only; when it **is** set, `warn`+ goes to **both** stderr and the toast (the operational channel is restored). With no sink (headless/tests), stderr keeps the default `warn`/`err` gate. The sink is TUI-agnostic — logger just calls the function pointer, no `lib → src` dependency.
- **Knobs:**
    - `NOVA_LOG_FILE`: Path to the log file (path max 1024 bytes).
    - `NOVA_LOG_STDERR_LEVEL`: Min level for stderr (default: `warn` in release, `err` in debug). One of `err|warn|info|debug`, case-insensitive. An explicit value is treated as "user wants stderr" and overrides the toast-only default.
    - `NOVA_LOG_MAX_BYTES`: Max size before rotation (default: 10MB). On launch, if the existing log exceeds this, `nova.log` is renamed to `nova.log.1` (one generation) and a fresh file starts.
- **Diagnostics:** To see all logs in release: `NOVA_LOG_STDERR_LEVEL=debug nova 2> err.log`.
- **Use `warn`, not `err`, for logged failures.** Zig 0.16's test runner hard-wires `log_err_count == 0` as a success gate: any `log.err(...)` from a passing test marks it failed. Many tests deliberately exercise error paths, so those messages must be `warn`. The stderr sink surfaces `warn` in **all** builds including ReleaseFast, so operational visibility is preserved without tripping the test gate. Reserve `err` for nothing in this codebase today — the gate makes it unusable. The pre-init escape hatch (`dispatch` when `stderr_ready == false`) writes raw to fd 2 via `std.c.write`.
